# Your Project's Name

Our project is called Balanced, a productivity application that aims to increase productivity levels for students of any age. We adapted this concept from our Innovation Made Possible (IMP) Project and refined it to incorporate gamification to our application. Making studying a more enjoyable process to students.

## Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features

- To Do List - Students are able to write down what they want to do for the day and check the ones that are completed, similar to a note application

- Timeline - Students are able to create a timeline based on the various projects or assignments they have by setting dates and to do things between their starting date and deadline.

- Music - As our design progresses, we hope to collaborate with Spotify and allows users of our application to connect to their Spotify account and listen to their choice of music.

- Work Bank - Part of our application that incorporate gamification where students will earn "coins" based on how many tasks they have completed. The more tasks completed, the more coins accumulated, allowing them to purchase in-game emoticons.

- Quizes - Part of our application that incoporate gamification to allow students to get tested based on what they learn with small quizes that comes with rewards.

- Friends - The application allows you to use with your friends, being able to see their progress with their tasks and assignments, providing a friendly competition to help boost each other's productivity.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
  - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
